# 👁️ Person Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8x + DeepSORT

This project performs real-time **detection and tracking of people** in a video using the **YOLOv8x** object detection model and **DeepSORT** multi-object tracking algorithm.

The goal is to accurately identify all people present in each frame, assign them unique IDs, and track them throughout the video, even in dense scenes and with partial occlusions.
